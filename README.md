### Nut shot bot

Running the get_an_injury.py script loads in a dataset of male genital injuries, optionally saving them as a csv for faster loading next time, and then presents the option to see a random genital injury or exit.

Is this really a bot? Does it only contain nut shots and no other male genital injuries? The answer to both of these things is no, but I thought it was a funny name
